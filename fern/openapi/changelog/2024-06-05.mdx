subtitle: "Launching Orders: See who purchased your NFTs from the Console"
---

**Starting today, June 5, 2024, you can see the list of orders for your NFT collections directly from the console. It includes detailed data for each order, including troubleshooting information.**

To access it, on the Crossmint Console, inside your collection, click on “Payments” and then click on “Orders” to access the Orders tab. The orders tab gives you a greater observability of order volume.

If you have further questions regarding this, contact [Crossmint Support]().
